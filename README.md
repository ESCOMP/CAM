# CAM: The Community Atmosphere Model

CAM code is stored in this repository on branches other than main.  The details are explained below.

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/ESCOMP/CAM/wiki) for complete documentation on CAM, getting started with git and how to contribute to CAM's development.

This repository has four officially-supported branches:
* main - contains this readme and the Code of Conduct information
* cam_cesm2_2_rel - contains the current CESM2.2 CAM code
* cam_cesm2_1_rel - contains the current CESM2.1 CAM code
* cam_development - contains the current CAM development code (see the important note below before using this branch)

There are other branches in this repo that have a `zz_` prefix which are used for special projects.  Please note that use of these branches is not-supported and may very likely produce un-scientific results in certain configurations.
