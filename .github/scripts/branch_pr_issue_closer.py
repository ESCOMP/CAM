Script name:  branch_PR_issue_closer.py

Goal:  To check if the newly-merged PR's commit message attempted to close an issue.
       If so, then move the associated project card to the "closed issues" column.

       Also checks if the newly-merged PR is the final PR needed to fix the issue
       for all related branches.  If so, then the issue is formally closed.

       Finally, this script also checks to see if the merged PR attempted
       to close other PRs, and does so if the merge was not to the repo's default branch.
