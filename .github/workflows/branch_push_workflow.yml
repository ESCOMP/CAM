name: Pushed commit workflow

#For some reason GitHub does not allow secrets
#when a PR from a fork is closed.  Thus instead
#the workflow must activate whenever a commit
#is pushed to the repo.  Theoretically this should
#behave the same way as if triggered from a pull
#request, just as long as no user ever pushes
#directly to the repo.
